Analysis code and reproducible research materials for a Maastricht University study of gender differences and trait-specific correlates of camouflaging in the context of autism traits.

## Overview

This repository contains the code used to examine variation in the three domains of the Camouflaging Autistic Traits Questionnaire (CAT-Q): **Compensation**, **Masking**, and **Assimilation**. The analyses evaluate whether CAT-Q scores differ between women and men, whether any differences persist after accounting for empathizing, systemizing, and autistic traits, and whether these trait associations vary by gender.

The work accompanies the manuscript:

> Monteiro, S., Ambraß, L., de Sousa Fernandes Perna, E., Blokland, A., Stauder, J. (2026). *Rethinking Gender Differences in Camouflaging: Multivariate Associations Across Compensation, Masking, and Assimilation.* 

## Analytical workflow

The notebook implements three sequential model stages:

1. **Model 1:** CAT-Q outcomes as a function of gender and age.
2. **Model 2:** Model 1 with Empathy Quotient (EQ), Systemizing Quotient (SQ), and 10-item Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ-10) added.
3. **Model 3:** Model 2 with gender × EQ, gender × SQ, and gender × AQ-10 interactions added.

Compensation, Masking, and Assimilation are modelled jointly using multivariate multiple linear regression. CAT-Q total is analysed separately because it is derived from the three subscales. The workflow includes:

- HC3 robust covariance estimation;
- pooling across 20 imputed datasets using Rubin's rules;
- multivariate Wald tests;
- Benjamini–Hochberg false-discovery-rate correction;
- gender-specific simple slopes and adjusted predictions;
- model-fit and Shapley variance decomposition;
- nonlinearity, overlap, collinearity, cutoff, and influence diagnostics;
- leave-one-participant-out stability analysis; and
- generation of manuscript figures and tables.
